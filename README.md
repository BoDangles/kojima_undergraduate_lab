# kojima_undergraduate_lab


# My name is Kyle Batty, I am an undergraduate research assistant for Dr. Kojima's lab.  I wrote the code in this repository in an effort to stream line the RNA-seq data processing system currently in place.  A couple notes to make this a better experience for all of us:

#   1) I have about 10-15 hours of experience with RStudio so in no way is this code written in an effecient manner but it works.
#   2) I ran all my commands through the cascades virtual terminal via https://ondemand.arc.vt.edu > Clusters > Cascades Shell Access.
#   3) I have an elementary understanding of the ARC.  I have written down techniques I used to download/install certain packages and softwares but there is most likely an easier/correct way to do those.
#   4) Lastly, I'm OCD when it comes to organizing files so every step is accompanied with its own directory for each file type.

# With that being said, I'll jump right in on how to get started!

# The very first step is to choose your data set, analyze it using https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, and organize it's information into an excel spreadsheet.  The formatting of the spreadsheet is VERY important.  VERY, VERY, VERY important.  I will attach a screen shot/.xlsx file to this repository as an example of the formatting.
